        <p>My name is Aldo Mancilla. I am from Guatemala and some of my hobbies are climbing volcanoes, basketball. I enjoy family time and nature that allows us to appreciate the impressive creations of our heavenly father. 
            I love everything related to design, creativity web design and e-commerce. I have been married for almost 20 years and I am father of 4 children, the oldest began his mission in Puerto Rico recently and it is 
            one of the things that makes me happy. Another thing that I really like is music and musical instruments, I like to play the piano and the accordion, I like to learn something new every day and it is one of my goals to do so 
            as well as share the knowledge that I obtain. with others, I feel grateful for Jesus Christ in my life and I strive to make him a central part of my life and that of my family.</p>
